# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.
Authors: William Pitchford, Sam R. Purpose: To implement sorting algorithms and understand their runtimes. Acknowledgements: Jayson Kunkel, helped me understand how quick and merge sort were supposed to recurse. GitHub link https://github.com/Scr0mble/sorting-mini-project, also ChatGPT for helping me find and write my sort, which is just an implementation of BucketSort. The experience using ChatGPT was almost frighteningly simple, I looked up a few quick sorting methods and decided I would use bucket sort. I then simply asked ChatGPT to write me an implementation of bucketsort using a comparator so as to work correctly with the sorter interface and it gave me one that worked perfectly after a few minor adjustments. I did have to correct it on one function usage, but upon being prompted that this was incorrect it gave me the code with the correct function for that specific line of code without any problems.
